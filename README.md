# Dataset Preparation Guide

This guide outlines the steps taken to prepare the dataset for analysis and modeling. Follow these steps to reproduce the processed dataset from the original files.

## Preparation Steps

1. **Combine Original Files**  
   Merge the four original files into a single dataset, saved as `full_combined_data_ready.csv`.

2. **Filter Malicious Traffic**  
   Select only the rows corresponding to malicious traffic for focused analysis.

3. **Group Attacks by Destination IP**  
   Organize the data by grouping attacks based on the destination IP address to identify attack patterns per target.

4. **Assign Attack IDs**  
   Create unique `attack_id`s for each attack instance based on defined threshold values.

5. **Generate Remaining Time Feature**  
   Calculate a `remaining_time` feature for each attack based on the attackâ€™s total duration and cumulative attack duration. This processed file is saved as `Victim_Dataset/combined_dataset_sorted_remaining_time.csv`.

6. **Create Data Sequences and Split Dataset**  
   Construct sequences of 30 flows for each `attack_id`, then split the data into train, validation, and test sets. The final dataset is saved in `final_seq_data`.

## Directory Structure
- **``**: original files.
- **`full_combined_data_ready.csv`**: Combined dataset from the original files.
- **`Victim_Dataset/combined_dataset_sorted_remaining_time.csv`**: Dataset with the `remaining_time` feature.
- **`final_seq_data`**: Directory containing the split datasets for training, validation, and testing.

## Notes

- Ensure that all original files are in the appropriate directory before beginning the preparation steps.
- The sequence length and data splitting can be adjusted as needed for different modeling requirements.
